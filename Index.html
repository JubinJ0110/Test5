        <div id="stuff"><h2>Introduction</h2></div>
        <p>
            My name is Jubin Joseph, I have one sister named Merin. We and our 
            parents live in Woodridge. My sister is currently in her senior year of college 
            at Loyola University. She majors in Psychology although she started out with Biology. 
            My mom work as a nurse and my dad works as a supervisor. My family likes to travel a 
            lot, especially my mom. Although my dad doesn't really like to travel because 
            airplanes and airports can be annoying. My favorite color is 
            <span style="color: blue;">blue.</span> We got a dog over the summer 
            which was pretty neat. We named him Benji and he's a cocker doodle. 
            He been a real hassle but he's super cute. My parents immigrated here from India back 
            in the 90s. My dad had already met my mom in india but he immigrated here first with 
            his brothers and sisters. He had a lot of siblings so I have a lot of aunts 
            and uncles and even more cousins. My major is Computer Science because I wanted to 
            try it out since I liked it in highschool.

        <div class="stuff"><h2>What I Hope to Learn in This Course</h2></div>
        <ul style="color: white; list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Learning more coding languages</li>
            <li>Learning about cloud computing</li>
            <li>Learning about AI</li>
            <li>Learning about networks</li>

        <div class="stuff"><h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2></div>
        <p>
            I suppose one of my favorite hobbies is playing video games. I like to play 
            Minecraft quite a bit although I haven't been able to do it as much because of 
            school so that's unfortunate. I also like to play Call of Duty. I mainly like to 
            play in my free time or when I'm stuck on assignments. I also like to play 
            with my friends at night when they're available and we generally like to try 
            different games. We all tried this one game called Sky which is really enjoyable. 
            We also tried to play this one game about delivering boxes which I thought would be 
            really fun but it was super laggy while we played in multiplayer which was really 
            annoying. Play mostly play together on mobile because it's convenient for all 
            of us and we are still able to chat on discord.
